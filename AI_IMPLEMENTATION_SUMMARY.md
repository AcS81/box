- ✅ `MirrorCardResponse` - AI understanding and insights

**Response Fields Include:**
- Estimated duration and difficulty
- Suggested subtasks with dependencies
- Calendar scheduling recommendations
- AI confidence scores
- Emotional tone analysis

### 4. Retry Mechanism and Caching

**Retry Features:**
- ✅ Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s max 30s)
- ✅ Automatic retry for rate limits and network errors
- ✅ Maximum 3 retry attempts
- ✅ Intelligent error differentiation

**Caching System:**
- ✅ 5-minute response cache
- ✅ Automatic cache key generation
- ✅ Memory-efficient cache management
- ✅ Cache size monitoring

### 5. Enhanced ContentView Integration

**Updates Made:**
- ✅ Uses singleton AIService.shared pattern
- ✅ Integrates UserContextService for context building
- ✅ Enhanced goal creation with AI-powered metadata
- ✅ Automatic subgoal generation
- ✅ Mirror card creation with AI analysis
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with fallbacks

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### AI Service Architecture

```swift
@MainActor
class AIService: ObservableObject {
    // Singleton pattern for consistent state
    static let shared = AIService()

    // Generic typed response processing
    func processRequest<T: Codable>(_ function: AIFunction, responseType: T.Type) async throws -> T

    // String response for conversational AI
    func processRequest(_ function: AIFunction) async throws -> String
}
```

### Context-Aware Prompting

All AI functions now receive an `AIContext` object containing:
- Recent goal history
- User behavioral patterns
- Completion statistics
- Preferred working hours
- Current time context

Example prompt enhancement:
```
USER CONTEXT:
Recent goals context:
- Learn SwiftUI (Now, 75% complete)
- Exercise daily (Next, 30% complete)
User has completed 5 goals so far.
Average goal completion time: 14 days.
User prefers working between 9:00 and 17:00.
Current time: Sep 29, 2025 at 11:06 AM
```

### Error Handling Strategy

1. **API Level**: HTTP status code handling with specific errors
2. **Parsing Level**: JSON cleanup and structured parsing
3. **Retry Level**: Exponential backoff for transient failures
4. **User Level**: Graceful fallbacks with basic functionality

### Response Model Validation

Each AI function has a dedicated response model:
- Type-safe parsing with Codable
- Optional fields for extensibility
- Nested structures for complex data
- Validation through Swift type system

## 📱 User Experience Improvements

### Goal Creation Flow

**Before:**
1. User enters text
2. Basic Goal object created
3. Simple title and category

**After:**
1. User enters text
2. AI analyzes with full context
3. Enhanced Goal with:
   - AI-refined title and description
   - Smart category assignment
   - Priority assessment
   - Automatic subgoal generation
   - Difficulty and duration estimates
4. Mirror card with AI insights
5. Fallback to basic creation if AI fails

### Context-Sensitive Responses

- AI considers user's goal completion history
- Recommendations adapt to user's working patterns
- Time-aware scheduling suggestions
- Personalized motivational messaging

## 🧪 Testing Implementation

**Test File:** `AIServiceTests.swift`

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Context creation and validation
- ✅ Goal extensions and computed properties
- ✅ JSON response parsing for all models
- ✅ Error scenarios and edge cases
- ✅ Mock data for consistent testing

## 📊 Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy
- 5-minute cache for identical requests
- Reduces API calls and improves responsiveness
- Memory-efficient with automatic cleanup

### Request Optimization
- 30-second timeout for all requests
- Appropriate temperature settings per function type
- Token limits optimized for each use case

### Background Processing
- All AI requests run on background threads
- UI updates dispatched to MainActor
- Non-blocking user interface

## 🔐 Security and Privacy

### API Key Management
- Environment variable configuration
- Never hardcoded in source
- Proper error handling for missing keys

### Data Minimization
- Only necessary context sent to AI
- Local processing preferred when possible
- No sensitive data in API requests

## 🎯 Next Steps and Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps
